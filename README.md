Code to replicate the findings in Gutierrez, Durandhar, Meyer, and Cecchi (2018).

Predictions are generated in four different scripts.  Two of the scripts are for the Direct models (DirSem, DirRat, DirMix in the text) and two of the scripts are for the Imputed models (ImpSem, ImpRat, ImpMix in the text).

DirectMolecules and ImputedMolecules show the effect of increasing the number of training molecules on the Direct and Imputed models, respectively; this is what is shown in Figure 3 of the paper.

DirectDescriptors and ImputedDescriptors show the effect of increasing the number of descriptors used during training on the Direct and Imputed models, respectively; this is what is shown in Figure 4a of the paper.
